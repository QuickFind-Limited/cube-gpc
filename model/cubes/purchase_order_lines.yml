    title: Purchase Order Lines
    description: >
      Purchase order line items with quantity, cost, and receipt tracking.
      FIX (v68.8): Changed on_order_value and avg_unit_cost measures to reference 'rate' field directly instead of 'unit_cost' dimension name.
      FIX (v68.10): Added CAST to total_received_qty - quantityshiprecv is STRING type in typed Parquet.
