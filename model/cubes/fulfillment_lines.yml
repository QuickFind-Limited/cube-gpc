NetSuite investigation shows ~10-13% of fulfillment lines have NULL location across all time periods (2024-2025), not 45% as initially reported. NULL locations appear consistently across all months with no specific pattern, suggesting this is expected behavior for certain fulfillment types (e.g., drop-ship, transfers, or pre-2024 data). FIX (v65): Verified actual NULL rate via NetSuite SuiteQL API - corrected from inflated 45% estimate to measured 10-13% reality."
