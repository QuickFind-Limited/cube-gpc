    title: Landed Costs Analysis
    description: >
      Landed costs (freight, duties, customs) from Item Receipts identified by null quantity pattern.
      These are additional costs added to inventory beyond the base item cost.

      Uses transaction_lines_denormalized_mv which includes foreignamount and subsidiary fields
      not available in the base transaction_lines table.

      NetSuite ItemRcpt lines follow a 5-line pattern per item:
        1. Receipt line: has quantity + rate + positive amount (inventory receipt)
        2. Landed cost line(s): NO quantity, NO rate, positive amount (freight/duty)
        3. Offset line(s): NO quantity, NO rate, negative amount (double-entry contra)

      This cube filters for positive amounts (amount > 0) with null/zero quantity to isolate
      landed cost lines from regular item receipt lines. No dependency on blandedcost field.
