    title: Landed Costs Analysis (INCOMPLETE - Missing blandedcost field)
    description: >
      ⚠️ WARNING: blandedcost field was not extracted from NetSuite transaction_lines.
      This cube cannot properly identify landed cost lines and will include ALL ItemRcpt lines.

      Original intent: Landed costs (freight, duties, customs) from Item Receipts identified by blandedcost='T' flag.
      These are additional costs added to inventory beyond the base item cost.

      Current behavior: Returns ALL Item Receipt lines with amount > 0, not just landed costs.
      To fix: Extract blandedcost field in transaction_lines extraction and uncomment WHERE clause filter.

      NetSuite stores landed costs using double-entry accounting with offsetting positive/negative amounts.
      This cube filters for positive amounts only (amount > 0). FIX (v66): Added amount > 0 filter to exclude
      offsetting negative entries (LAND001).
