# DEPRECATED: This cube has a design flaw - it mixes all-time sales with point-in-time inventory
# Result: Meaningless ratios like "all sales ever / today's stock"
# REPLACEMENT: Use sell_through_seasonal.yml for accurate season-based sell-through analysis
# TODO: Remove this cube after migrating all dashboards to sell_through_seasonal
